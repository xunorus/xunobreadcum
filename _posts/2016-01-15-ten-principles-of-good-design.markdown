Rams, the ten principle for good design are that your product will be:

-    Innovative. Not innovative for innovation’s sake, but innovative hand-in-hand with innovative technology.
-    Useful. You want your product to be used. Why would you design it and include anything that would get in the way of that?
-    Aesthetic. A product should be beautiful. Your intent is that it is used often, daily even. You don’t want to affect people’s lives negatively by having them become accustomed to an ugly product.
-    Understandable. A product’s design is part of what helps its user understand how to use it. They work together.
-    Unobtrusive. A product should force itself on the user. It should be pleasing to look at, but not demand attention other than the fact that it is useful.
-    Honest. Products should look like what they are. They shouldn’t have a facade that makes them appear to be more or less than what they are meant to do.
-    Long-lasting. Quite simply, trends don’t last. Products that are trendy will soon look ridiculous and aged. Good design is ageless.
-    Detailed focused. No guessing on if the user will figure it ou. Every detail of how the product will be used is considered important.
-    Environmentally friendly. Design to use as few resources as possible. But also, does your product fit in with the environment it will be in? Is it a sign that clashes with the place it will end up?
-    Have as little design as possible. Forget the frills and excess. Design what is necessary to make a beautiful product that is easy to use. No more.
