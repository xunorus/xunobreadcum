##Towards a music of the abundance

I grow up in the culture of closed propietary software. Profesors taught windows and its programms to class, and although there was no knonw choice, there wasnt alternatives either to all those  fascinating new experiences.

It took me several years to realize what FOSS was about. Once I did it i discovered that  abusement and  impositions wasnt  just happening to software users, and malicious and improper thing were already happening on alimentation, on education .

As a composer i'm free to express. The receip of my composition is the listener but htere is also an intermediary, as important as the composer, the performer.

##The message in music

Music is the message. The message is not the music.
