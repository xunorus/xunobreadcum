- The idea of having nations
and governments

is as foolish
as keeping
the human
and spirit realms separate.

You've had to deal
with a moronic president
and a tyrannical queen.
Don't you think the world
would be better off
if leaders like them
were eliminated?
- No.
I mean, I don't really agree
with what they've done,
but taking out world leaders
isn't the answer.
- It wasn't too long ago
that the airbenders
were nearly all wiped out
thanks to the fire lord's desire
for world dominance.


True freedom
can only be achieved
when oppressive governments
are torn down.

- But that won't bring balance.
It will throw the world
into chaos.

- Exactly.
The natural order
is disorder.

Do you know who once said,

"new growth cannot exist
without first
the destruction
of the old"?

- No.
- The wise guru laghima,
an airbender.
