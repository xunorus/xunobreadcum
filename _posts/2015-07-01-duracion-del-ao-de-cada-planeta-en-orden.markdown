1. Mercury: One year on planet Mercury takes just 87.97 earth days. This means that if you are 15 years old on Earth you would be 62 years old in Mercury years.

2. Venus: It takes 224.7 earth days for Venus to travel once around the sun. If you are 15 years old on Earth, this would make you 24 years old in Venus years.

3. Earth: One year on planet Earth, or one orbit around the sun, takes 365.26 days.

4. Mars: Planet Mars goes around the sun once every 686.98 earth days. Hence, a 15 years old from Earth would actually be almost 8 years old in Mars years.

5. Jupiter: The planet Jupiter travels around the sun one time every 4,332.82 earth days. This would make a 15 year old from earth be barely over 1 year old in Jupiter years.

6. Saturn: Saturn goes around the sun once every 10,755.7 earth days. If you had lived 15 years on Earth, then you would be a little over half of one year old in Saturn years.

7. Uranus: Uranus completes one revolution around the sun every 30,687.15 earth days. Thus, a 15 year old from earth would be .17 years old in Uranus years.

8. Neptune: It takes Neptune 60,190.03 earth days to go around the sun. A 15 year old from Earth would be .09 years old in Neptune years.

9. Pluto: The dwarf planet Pluto takes 90,553 earth days to go around the sun. If you were 15 years old on Earth you would be .06 years old in Pluto years.
