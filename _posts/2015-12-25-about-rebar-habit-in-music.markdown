Rebar and rephrase habits ussually happen in order to clarify how to prhased it, a simplification.

Leonard Bernstein rebared the Rite of Spring ( which was objected by the entire new york filarmonic).



MIlan Kundera quote:
Kundera says: "What irritates me in Adorno is his short-circuit method that, with a fearsome facility, links works of art to political (sociological) causes, consequences, or meanings; extremely nuanced ideas (Adorno's musicological knowledge is admirable) thereby lead to extremely impoverished conclusions"; in fact, given that an era's political tendencies are always reducible to just two opposing tendencies, a work of art necessarily ends up being classified as either progressive or reactionary; and since reaction is evil, the inquisition can start the trial proceedings" (Testaments Betrayed, 91).
