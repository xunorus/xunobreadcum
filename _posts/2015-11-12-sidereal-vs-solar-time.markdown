The main difference is tha one is considered by the earth facing constantly the sun, while in the other has nothing to do with the sun, the earth is facing a star in the background.

## Sidereal day
23.9344 696 hours

I think this shows off the spiral.

## Solar day
origin of the solar day
24.0000 hs exactly

every day is 24 solar hours.
Solar day = 24 hours and 360.98 degrees of rotation.

## summing up
f solar day, the Earth rotates more than 360 degrees for one solar day (24h) and exactly 360 deg for one sidereal day (23:56:4)

WE DO NOT (just)ORBIT THE SUN.
we follow the sun follinw the galaxy center.
