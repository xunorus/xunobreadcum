# MUSIC IN THE OPEN

# sacred geometry of sound
Fundamental of acustics from the perspective of sound.
We start listening to a vibration,
 we analise it
 we see it expand through its harmonics
 the 2 is the octave, third the fifth, and so.

#### Listening the universe

This is an exercise  to develop yourself into the art of the listening:
We hear for a minute an apparently monotone sound.
One minute per landscape.
Then we try to remember and write down the sum up of the experience in thirty seconds (or a random intervale between 3 and 300 seconds) and describe  different aspects of sound experience.

An apparent monotone sound, just noises or  or a social environment may sound interesting and can be developed in an artistic language.
Then we share each individual experience within collective.
This sentient collective self ofen reveals new perspectives that enriches and influences perceived by other sentient beings.
